description: We stick to [Bootstrap's global settings for typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/typography/#global-settings).
             We use Bootstrap [typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/typography/) and [text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/text/) classes when needed.
             We use the [default fonts from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) with the default font-size of `16px`.
